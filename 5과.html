        <span><strong>제 5과 한국어 문장구조 순서(Korean Sentence Strcture) </strong></span><br><br>
        
        <p> What is the order of a Korean sentence? Is it like English? <br>
            It can be said that it is totally different as English.<br>
            Let’s study Korean sentence structure. 
            Korean sentences consist of either a subject + predicate(verb) or a subject + object + predicate(verb).<br>
            Look at the example below:<br><br>
        
            <img src="../images/korean grammar stracture1.png"><br>
            
            <strong>1.아이가 먹어요. Chlid eats</strong><br>
            <strong>2.사람이 자요.  people sleeps</strong><br>

            <img src="../images/korean grammar stracture2.png"><br>

            <strong>1.아이가 샌드위치를 먹어요. Chlid eats a sandwich</strong><br>
            <strong>2.사람이 물을 마셔요.  people drinks a water</strong><br><br>

            This is one of the big differences between Korean and English <br>
            because a verb comes at the end of the sentence in Korean, and at the beginning of the sentence in English. <br><br>
            Next, topic is Korean grammar and particle usage. As you can see in the example above, <br>
            particles are attached to words in Korean sentences and express the role of words in the sentence. <br>
            Using the right particles is very important of speaking Korean fluently. <br>
            But you will ask me what is the <strong>particle usage</strong>? Let's look together.<br><br>

            <strong>1.아이(가) 샌드위치를 먹어요. Chlid eats a sandwich</strong><br>
            <strong>2.사람(이) 물을 마셔요.  people drinks a water</strong><br><br>

            As you can see the example,particles are attached to words in Korean sentences. <br>
            Like <strong style="color: red;" >이 or 가</strong> there are about 20 different particles in Korean.<br>
            But in this lesson we will only learn about most confusing particles and the differences between them, <strong style="color: red;" >
            이/가 and 은/는.</strong><br><br>

            <strong style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">N은/는</strong> follows a noun, indicating that it is the topic under discussion.<br>
           It means that is used when the speaker wants to talk about or explain the main idea, topic, or issue of discussion<br>
           That is why N은/는 are called topic markers. When can you use 은 or 는?<br><br>
            Nouns that finish with a vowel, 는 is added, and for words that end with a consonant, 은 is added.<br>
            Exmaple: 그녀(는) 미국 사람이에요. She is an American.<br>
                    마이클(은) 호주 사람이에요. Michle is Australian.<br><br>

            <strong style="font-weight: bold; color: red;"> 이/가</strong> are called Subject Particles.<br>
            This particle is added to the end of a subject to designate it as the subject of the sentence. <br>
            For words that finish with a vowel, 가 is added, and for words that end with a consonant, 이 is added.<br><br>
